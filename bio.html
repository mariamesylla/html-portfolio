            They are not just activities for me; they're sources of tranquility and rejuvenation. 
            The balance between my family life, the pursuit of
            knowledge, and my appreciation for nature shapes who I am.
            These personal experiences and interests have instilled in me a drive to 
            approach my professional life with the same enthusiasm and determination.

            I'm excited about my journey as a junior engineer apprentice and eager to take 
            on the challenges of full-stack development as I embark on my upcoming role at 
            American Express in January.
            I previously worked as an IT specialist at a public school, where 
            I gained hands-on experience in troubleshooting, maintaining computer systems, and providing technical 
            support to students and staff. My time in the field has shaped my
            passion for technology and problem-solving.
